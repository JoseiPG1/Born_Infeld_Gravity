\title{My notes on the Born-Infeld gravity}

\begin{document}



Einstein-Hilbert action:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The action is not well-posed and it is needed to add boundary terms that do not impact the field equations,
    they have important thermodynamical aas well as geometrical implications
\end{itemize}

Eddington gravity
\begin{itemize}
    \item The field equations coming from varying the action leads to the EFE with a non vanishing cosmological constant.
    \item Is a well-posed variational problem.
    \item It is not possible to add matter to the model without the metric tensor
    \item This provides a landscape for the Born-Infeld gravity.
\end{itemize}
